# DH110 Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype
Cari Jung • DH110 • Fall 2022

## Description of Project
#### Purpose and Process of Interactive Prototype Phase
The objective of this high fildelity prototype is to provide a highly functional and interactive representation of the UNEP website and to see how those features influence the user's choice and performance. I changed the frames from the low fidelity prototype to fit a cellular device since there are more users who have access to a cellphone than a laptop or computer. I used the prototyping features in Figma to make components such as buttons and the hamburger menu clickable to allow clicking to increment to the next page or display an overlay. A cognitive walkthrough was also conducted and changes were made to improve the design. 

## Tasks
>  The tasks were generated from the user personas and scenarios 

• Task 1: Create a personalized data based on sustainbaility topics and country/region(s)

• Task 2: Access information about each sustainable goal

## Cognitive Walkthrough
The cognitive walkthrough was conducted with two of my peers in Digital Humanities 110. This process took 15 minutes and they performed two tasks: creating their own data and accessing information about sustainability. While conducting each rask, they gave their impression and thoughts about the high fidelity prototype.

### Summary of Cognitive Walkthrough
My peers were able to understand the purpose of the prototype and made remarks about the understandable flow. The biggest issue found was the overwhelming menu bar (especially for mobile devices) and the vague "What we do" navigation tab that prevented them from recognizing where to click to perform the tasks. They did not know what to expect when pressing the tab. Other elements that were brought to my attention include the small font and the how there were no indicators in the homescreen that told them the page was scrollable, which led to them missing information.   

#### • Changes I made
> Instead of a laundry list of menus in the “what we do” tab, I created a separate page that shows all the options. The fonts for each option is enlarged and is displayed in the form of a button that prompts the users to the designated page.

> I changed the font of the body texts from size 11 to 14. 

> To make the homepage look scrollable I removed some whitespace so that the page doesn't look like it ends at the "See More" button. Now, users can see the image that is cut off at the bottom of the screen, which prompts them to scroll and see more and discover more infomation.

#### • Other changes made post cognitive walkthrough
> I decreased the saturation of the 17 icons so the page isn't too bright. 

> I changed the color contrast of the color blue so the white fonts and backgrounds pass the 4.5:1 contrast ratio.
