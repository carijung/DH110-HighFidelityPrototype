Cari Jung • DH110 • Fall 2022

## Description of Project
#### Purpose and Process of Interactive Prototype Phase
The objective of this high fildelity prototype is to provide a highly functional and interactive representation of the UNEP website. I changed the frames from the low fidelity prototype to fit a cellular device since there are more users who have access to a cellphone than a laptop or computer. I used Figma to make components such as buttons and the hamburger menu clickable to allow clicking to incremently complete a specific task and to see how those features influence the user's choice and performance.

## Tasks
>  The tasks were generated from the user personas and scenarios 

• Task 1: Create a personalized data based on sustainbaility topics and country/region(s)

•  Task 2: Find information about each sustainable goal
