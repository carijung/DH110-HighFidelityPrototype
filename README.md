# DH110 Assignment 7: High Fidelity Prototype
Cari Jung • DH110 • Fall 2022

## Description of Project
#### Purpose and Process of Interactive Prototype Phase
The objective of this high fildelity prototype is to provide a highly functional and interactive representation of the UNEP website. I changed the frames from the low fidelity prototype to fit a cellular device since there are more users who have access to a cellphone than a laptop or computer. I used Figma to make components such as buttons and the hamburger menu clickable to allow clicking to incremently complete a specific task and to see how those features influence the user's choice and performance.

## Tasks
>  The tasks were generated from the user personas and scenarios 
#### • Task 1: Create a personalized data based on sustainbaility topics and country/region(s)
#### •  Task 2: Find information about each sustainable goal

Evidence of cognitive walkthrough
If you have multiple versions of prototypes by reflecting the evaluation with others, provide them with the description of what you learned from other’s feedback and what you have made the changes.
